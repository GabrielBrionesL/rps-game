Udacity's IPND - Rock Paper Scissors Project
In this project, I applied Python and object-oriented programming skills to build a program that plays 
the game of Rock Paper Scissors. 

I built classes that represent the game and its players. I wrote classes of computer players that follow various different 
strategies, as well as a human player class that lets a human play the game against the computer.
